## 4. Create Astra DB Instance

**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 20M read/write operations, 80GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.

#### ‚úÖ 4a. Register 

If you do have an account yet register and sign In to Astra DB this is FREE and NO CREDIT CARD asked. [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.dev/11-22): You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

#### ‚úÖ 4b. Create a "FREE" plan

Follow this [guide](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html), to set up a pay as you go database with a free $25 monthly credit. You will find below recommended values to enter:

- **For the database name** - `workshops`

- **For the keyspace name** - `spring_petclinic`

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

- **For provider and region**: Choose a provider (GCP, Azure or AWS) and then the related region is where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users).

- **Create the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the `Create Database` button.

You will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.

![my-pic](doc/img//db-pending.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

**üëÅÔ∏è Walkthrough**

*The Walkthrough mentions the wrong keyspace, make sure to use `spring_petclinic`*

## 5. Create your schema with CQL Console

#### ‚úÖ 5a. Select keyspace in CQL Console

As seen in the slides on the contrary of relational you start with the request and data model BEFORE CODING.

Let's start with the CQL console for the database as whown below.

![image](doc/img/db-cqlconsole-1.png?raw=true)

Next, let's create the tables. In the CQL console use the command:

```sql
use spring_petclinic;
```

![image](doc/img/db-cqlconsole-2.png?raw=true)

#### ‚úÖ 5b. Create tables

Following is the data model we are looking for with 6 tables.

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/data-model.png?raw=true)

Execute the following in the cql console

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet (
  id          uuid,
  first_name  text,
  last_name   text,
  specialties set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_vet_by_specialty (
 specialty   text,
 vet_id      uuid,
 first_name  text,
 last_name   text,
 PRIMARY KEY ((specialty), vet_id)
);


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_owner (
  id         uuid,
  first_name text,
  last_name  text,
  address    text,
  city       text,
  telephone  text,
  PRIMARY KEY ((id))
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_pet_by_owner (
  owner_id   uuid,
  pet_id     uuid,
  pet_type   text,
  name       text,
  birth_date date,
  PRIMARY KEY ((owner_id), pet_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_visit_by_pet (
   pet_id      uuid,
   visit_id    uuid,
   visit_date  date,
   description text,
   PRIMARY KEY ((pet_id), visit_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_reference_lists (
  list_name text,
  values set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((list_name))
);

/** We could search veterinarians by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_ownername ON petclinic_owner(last_name);
/** We could search vet by their names. */
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS petclinic_idx_vetname ON petclinic_vet(last_name);
```

#### ‚úÖ 5c. Check our 6 tables

```sql
describe tables;
```

#### ‚úÖ 5d. Insert Reference Data

```sql
INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('pet_type ', {'bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'lizard','hamster','snake'});

INSERT INTO petclinic_reference_lists(list_name, values) 
VALUES ('vet_specialty', {'radiology', 'dentistry', 'surgery'});
```

## 6. Create Astra Token

To connect to the database from Java code we need some credentials, this is what we are going to do here.

#### ‚úÖ 6a. Generate Token

Following the [Manage Application Tokens docs](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) create a token with `Database Admnistrator` roles.

- Go the `Organization Settings`

- Go to `Token Management`

- Pick the role `Database Admnistrator` on the select box

- Click Generate token

**üëÅÔ∏è Walkthrough**

![image](doc/img/astra-create-token.gif?raw=true)

This is what the token page looks like. You can now download the values as a CSV. We will need those values but you can also keep this window open for use later.

![image](doc/img/astra-token.png?raw=true)

Notice the clipboard icon at the end of each value.

- `clientId:` We will use it as a _username_ to contact to the Cassandra database

- `clientSecret:` We will use it as a _password_ to contact to the Cassandra database

- `appToken:` We will use it as a api token Key to interact with APIs.

#### ‚úÖ 6b. Copy your token in your clipboard

To know more about roles of each token you can have a look to [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUTCLsBuUd4&list=PL2g2h-wyI4SpWK1G3UaxXhzZc6aUFXbvL&index=8)

**Note: Make sure you don't close the window accidentally or otherwise - if you close this window before you copy the values, the application token is lost forever. They won't be available later for security reasons.**

We are now set with the database and credentials. Let's start coding with Spring !

### 7. Start Gitpod and Setup your application

#### ‚úÖ 7a. Open Gitpod

Click the button below it should route you to your workspace:
[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive)

When you first launch gitpod, it builds the image.
![image](doc/img/building-workspace.png?raw=true)

Gitpod pulls the image.
![image](doc/img/pulling-image.png?raw=true)


#### üìò Home Screen

This is the home Screen. It is a VSCode instance in the cloud. As you can see, notice multiple panels are open with 2 terminals, the readme and the explorer. 
![image](doc/img/start-ui.png?raw=true)

#### üìò How to open a new terminal

You can open a new terminal from the menu in the ellipsis in the top left hand corner. Then use the Switch terminal panel to move from one to another.
![image](doc/img/gitpod-new-terminal.png?raw=true)


#### ‚úÖ 7b. Know your gitpod

#### ‚úÖ 7c. Setup your application

Locate the File `application.yaml` in the folder `src/main/resources`, there your 3 properties that need to be updated marked with `CHANGE_ME`.

- Open the file
```bash
 gp open /workspace/workshop-spring-reactive/src/main/resources/application.yml
 ```

- Edit the lines with the `CHANGE_ME` to include the database properties.

```yaml
# Enforce listening on port 9966
server:
  port: 9966
    
# Setup your application
astra:
  application-token: <CHANGE_ME>
  database-id: <CHANGE_ME>
  database-region: <CHANGE_ME>
  keyspace: spring_petclinic
  metrics:
    enabled: false
```

- *The DatabaseID is located on the home page*
![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/astra-config-1.png?raw=true)

- *The Database region (and keyspace) are located in the details page*
![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/astra-config-2.png?raw=true)

- *Make sure the Token looks something like (with AstraCS: preceeding `AstraCS:xxxxxxxxxxx:yyyyyyyyyyy`*

#### ‚úÖ 7d. Validate your setup

Take a look at the code of [`Test01_Connectivity`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/test/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/Test01_Connectivity.java) here we use the `CqlSession` and `AstraClient` to show some infromation regarding your Astra DB. Execute the test with:

```bash
cd /workspace/workshop-spring-reactive
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test01_Connectivity
```

## 8. Working with Cassandra Drivers

#### ‚úÖ 8a. The CqlSession

The integration to Cassandra is always implemented through the `CqlSession`. A first way to implement a DAO is to just use this object explicitly. Check the code at [`Test02_DaoWithCqlSession`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/test/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/Test02_DaoWithCqlSession.java) and run the following test:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test02_DaoWithCqlSession
```

1. Notice how you needed to put a terminal call `block()` on line 21 or the program is not started.

Project [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) is a fourth-generation reactive library, based on the Reactive Streams specification, for building non-blocking applications on the JVM. We are using the library reactor-test introducing `StepVerifier` to ease the coding of unit tests:

```java
@Test
public void should_list_vet_specialies() {
 System.out.println(referenceListDao
   .findReferenceList("vet_specialty").block());
        
 StepVerifier
  .create(referenceListDao.findReferenceList("vet_specialty"))
  .expectNext(Set.of("dentistry", "radiology", "surgery"))
  .expectComplete()
  .verify();
}
```
> üñ•Ô∏è Expected output
```
15:34:33.926 INFO  com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test02_DaoWithCqlSession : Started Test02_DaoWithCqlSession in 14.782 seconds (JVM running for 16.99)
[dentistry, radiology, surgery]
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 16.42 s - in com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test02_DaoWithCqlSession
```

#### ‚úÖ 8b. The Driver Object Mapping Layer

We will illustrate this with the `Vet` in this [package](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/tree/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db)

1.  Define an `@Entity` where object attributes matches the table columns [`VetEntity`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db/VetEntity.java)

2. Define an `@Dao` interface with only the method you want to implements [`VetReactiveDao`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db/VetReactiveDao.java)

```java
@Dao
public interface VetReactiveDao {

 @Select
 MappedReactiveResultSet<VetEntity> findById(@NotNull UUID vetId);

 // More methods....
}
```

3. Define the `@Mapper` to explain how to create the `Dao` from the the Cqlsession. [`VetReactiveDaoMapper`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/vet/db/VetReactiveDaoMapper.java)

```java
@Mapper
public interface VetReactiveDaoMapper {
  @DaoFactory
  VetReactiveDao vetDao(@DaoKeyspace CqlIdentifier keyspace);
}
```

Now execute the test to work with the DAO `Test03_DaoWithDriverObjectMapping`

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test03_DaoWithDriverObjectMapping
```

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 9. Working with Spring Data

[Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) provides a common abstraction on top of multiple databases leveraging JPA. The quantity of code is greatly reduced by working with interfaces `CrudRepository` and entities.

- Define an entity [`VetEntitySpring`]() where object attributes matches the table columns. You can notice that the set of annotations is not the same as with java driver mapper.

- Define an interface extending the `ReactiveCassandraRepository` named `VetRepositorySpring`

```java
@Repository
public interface VetRepositorySpring 
   extends ReactiveCassandraRepository<VetEntitySpring, UUID> {
}
```

#### ‚úÖ 9a. Execute the unit test

Execute the test to work with the DAO `Test04_DaoWithSpringData`

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test04_DaoWithSpringData
```

## 10. Working with Spring WebFlux

> [Reference Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)

*The original web framework included in the Spring Framework, Spring Web MVC, was purpose-built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers. The reactive-stack web framework, Spring WebFlux, was added later in version 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs on such servers as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.*

*Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules (spring-webmvc and spring-webflux) and co-exist side by side in the Spring Framework. Each module is optional. Applications can use one or the other module or, in some cases, both‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâfor example, Spring MVC controllers with the reactive WebClient.*

The different DAO we created is injected into a Rest controller. (same as Spring WEB)

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/petclinic/api/specialties")
public class VetSpecialtyController {
 
 @Autowired
 ReferenceListReactiveDao dao;

 @GetMapping(produces = APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
 public Mono<ResponseEntity<Set<VetSpecialty>>> getAllVetsSpecialties() {
   return refDao.findReferenceList("vet_specialty")
    .map(Set::stream)
    .map(s -> s.map(VetSpecialty::new)
    .collect(Collectors.toSet()))
    .map(ResponseEntity::ok);
 }
}
```

#### ‚úÖ 10a. Execute the unit test

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=com.datastax.workshop.petclinic.Test05_ApiController
```

#### ‚úÖ 10b. Start the application with Swagger UI

We also used SpringDOC to generate a Swagger UI interface. For more information check the class [`ApiDocumentationConfig`](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-reactive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/datastax/workshop/petclinic/conf/ApiDocumentationConfig.java)

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/petclinic/api/specialties")
@Api(value="/petclinic/api/specialties", tags = {"Veterinarian Specialties Api"})
public class VetSpecialtyController {
  //...
}
```

You can now go ahead and start the application. The application is listening on port `9966` as defined in `application.yaml` *(Please do not change this, this is what the user interface is looking for)*


Start the application;
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Open your browser on port `9966` using the the remote explorer or entering in a new terminal.

```bash
gp preview "$(gp url 9966)"
```

You should find the Nice user interface:

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/swagger.png?raw=true)

#### ‚úÖ 10c. Use API

Locate the resource `Veterinarian Specialties Api` and  method the specialities endpoint below to test the service.

```bash
GET ‚Äã/petclinic‚Äã/api‚Äã/specialties
```

To execute the service expand the method, locate the button `[TRY IT OUT]` 

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/tryit-1.png?raw=true)

Click `[Execute]`, this particular method does not take any argument.

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/tryit-2.png?raw=true)

You should see a response something like below.

## 11. Angular User Interface

>[Reference Documentation](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/spring-petclinic-angular/)

>[Source Code](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular/tree/4f58177e29476a4866723a7edc6dab614e96eec0)

Keep the application running on the first terminal. We need our backend. Let'us start the user interface.

#### ‚úÖ 11a. Start the front end

On the terminal `spring-petclinic-angular:npm` navigate to the Angular application.

```bash
chunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 331 kB [initial] [rendered]
chunk {polyfills} polyfills.js, polyfills.js.map (polyfills) 293 kB [initial] [rendered]
chunk {polyfills-es5} polyfills-es5.js, polyfills-es5.js.map (polyfills-es5) 463 kB [initial] [rendered]
chunk {runtime} runtime.js, runtime.js.map (runtime) 6.08 kB [entry] [rendered]
chunk {scripts} scripts.js, scripts.js.map (scripts) 411 kB [entry] [rendered]
chunk {styles} styles.js, styles.js.map (styles) 1.16 MB [initial] [rendered]
chunk {vendor} vendor.js, vendor.js.map (vendor) 6.87 MB [initial] [rendered]
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdmÔΩ£: Compiled successfully.
```

- Kill the running application (the frontend must start after the backend here)

```
CTRL+C
```

- Start the application again
```
 cd /workspace/workshop-spring-reactive/spring-petclinic-angular
 npm run start
```

#### ‚úÖ 11b. Open the user interface


Open your browser on port `4200` using the the remote explorer or entering in a new terminal.

```bash
gp preview "$(gp url 4200)"
```

![Pet Clinic Welcome Screen](doc/img/ui-top.png?raw=true)

This is it for the Hands-on TODAY. The angular project is a separate project on its own and we simply reuse it as a submodule but did not code anything there.
